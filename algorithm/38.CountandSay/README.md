### 题目 💗[medium]

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```bash
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as "one 1" or 11.
`11` is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
`21` is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

Example 1:

```bash
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```

Example 2:

```bash
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```
