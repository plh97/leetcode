### 题目 💗[easy]

We are given two strings, A and B.

A shift on A consists of taking string A and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if A = 'abcde', then it will be 'bcdea' after one shift on A. Return True if and only if A can become B after some number of shifts on A.

Example 1:

```bash
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'cdeab'
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```bash
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'abced'
Output: false
```

Note:

1. A and B will have length at most 100.
